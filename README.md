tracert - Ultra Hacking Tool
----------------------------

We stumbled on this funny video at work where a young guy basically gave a tutorial about how to use
the `traceroute` tool to "see how many people are on the website, their IP addresses and their connection
speed". The funniest thing is, he's on a Windows machine and the traceroute tool is actually called
`tracert`, which he pronounces "tracer-tee".

Needless to say, `tracert` became a regular office gag where would be run it in a couple terminals if
someone left their computers unlocked. We were all hackers.

Check out the original video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXmv8quf_xM). I'd like to hope the
guy is a remarkably proficient troll. Seriously.
